- HOC: Component => EnhancedComponent
- HOC wraps the input component in a container component
- Container vs presentational components - do more of this
- fetchResource example
- HOC = parameterized container component

- onlyUpdateForKeys
- withContext
- test â€“ show spinner example
- mapPropsStream (rx-recompose) - let's you use RX operators - see ResctConf talk

- Use less shouldComponentUpdate

- HOCs aren't free - every (e.g. wrapper) component has a cost
- createEagerElement can flatten component heirarchy (vs. lazy)
    - "referentially transparent functional component"
    - "component squashing"
    - can only flatten functional components
- compose(mapPropsStream(t1), mapPropsStream(t2), mapPropsStream(t3)) = mapPropsStream(compose(t1, t2, t3)) - flatten class based components (as long as they don't use lifecycle methods)
