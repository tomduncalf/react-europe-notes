New features:
- Batch API (query string)
- @defer: Defer query parts, sent as patches over a single network request
- @stream: get each item in serial rather than parallel and send as soon as they are ready

Real time updates:
- Polling is inefficient
- Issues with websockets/0MQ/notifications:
    + under/overfetching
    + versioning
- @live: implements observables, sending delta payloads

GraphQL subscriptions:
- Data dependencies:
    + FB has no reactive backend and hard to detect when data has change e.d. likeSentence example
    + Instead clients subscribe to an action with a GraphQL query
    + Works for many subcribers with different queries
    + API is similar to `mutation` â€“ can reuse the same fragments across read, write and subscribe
