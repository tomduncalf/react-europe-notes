- Problem: generic endpoints sent too much data when not needed. URL parameters unwieldy.
- Falcor allows you to expose multiple services as a single JSON endpoint
- Falcor handles caching
- "Demand Driven Architecture(/Design)"
- Falcor may be easier to integrate gradually as less presciptive, fewer concepts

- Falcor does not require you to define a schema or use a query syntax - just JS paths (inc. range and multiple properties)
- JSON is for trees – but most domain models are graphs
- Falcor introduces JSON Graph - JSON + references cf. symlinks - $ref helper
- falcor-express-middleware
- Falcor.HttpDataSource

- Any pure function can be represented as a map
- Falcor better suited for less dynamic queries – predictable query shapes
- With Falcor each application can decide how to update components
